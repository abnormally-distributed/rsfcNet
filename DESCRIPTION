Description: This package is a companion to the igraph package which facilitates the analysis of resting state functional MRI data. The package contains several entirely custom-written functions to implement preparation of data for analysis (scrubbing, as described in Power et al, 2012) along with certain graph theory metrics or neuroscience-appropriate variations of existing metrics not available in igraph. Other functions are convenience functions to facilitate the analysis of large numbers of pairwise comparisons for large P and P>>n situations and variable/model selection with publication/presentation-ready results tables.
