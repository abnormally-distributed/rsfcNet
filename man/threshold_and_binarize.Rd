\title{Binarize a correlation matrix.}
\usage{
threshold_and_binarize(c, q)
}
\arguments{
\item{c}{The correlation matrix.}

\item{q}{The quantile to threshold. Defaults to .95, such that all below the 95th quantile are set to zero.}
}
\value{
A binary adjacency matrix
}
\description{
Threshold a correlation matrix and convert it to an un-weighted (binary) adjacency matrix.
}
\examples{
threshold_and_binarize(matrix, q=.90) # This should threshold such that only positive values are returned.
threshold_and_binarize(abs(matrix), q=.90) # Taking the absolute value of the matrix will allow negative correlations sufficiently strong to be included as an edge.
