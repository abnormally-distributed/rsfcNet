\title{Calculate eigenvector centrality for multiple graphs.}
\usage{
eigen_centr_mult(
  graphs,
  normalize = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  col.names = NULL,
  row.names = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graphs}{a list of igraph objects.}

\item{normalize}{how the normalization of eigenvector centrality should be treated. The options are as follows: \cr
\cr
If 0, no normalization is applied.  \cr
If 1, the absolute value of the principal eigenvector is used as in the MATLAB Brain Connectivity Toolbox (Rubinov & Sporns, 2010),
but no normalization is applied.  \cr
If 2, the principal eigenvector is taken as an absolute value, and the result is divided
by the maximum value such that the largest eigenvector centrality is 1.  \cr
If 3, the ranks of the raw eigenvector are taken, and the ranks divided by the maximum rank such that the largest eigenvector centrality is 1. \cr
If 4, eigenvector entries less than zero are set to zero, and then the scores are divided by the maximum value such that the largest eigenvector centrality is 1. \cr
If 5, the raw ranks of the principal eigenvector entries are returned. \cr}

\item{col.names}{The names of each column (node labels).}

\item{row.names}{The names of each row (subject).}
}
\value{
A vector of centrality scores for each node.

A matrix of the eigenvector centralities of each node for each subject.
}
\description{
This function calculates the eigenvector centrality for multiple graphs.
}
\details{
The eigenvector centrality is the eigenvector for each node corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the matrix.

Eigenvector centrality differs from degree or strength.
A node with many connections does not necessarily have a high eigenvector
centrality. For example, a node may have many very weak connections that yield a large value for strength/degree.
Likewise, a node with high eigenvector centrality may have few connections but be well connected to a small number
of important nodes.
